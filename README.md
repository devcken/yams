Yammy is a YAML processor, implemented in *Scala*. It also is a kind of handbook for YAML.

## Goals

- full compliance with [YAML 1.2 specification](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).
- implementation using [scala-parser-combinator](https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators) 
to express ABNF as it is.
- [Unicode](https://unicode.org/) support for [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)/
[UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16)/[UTF-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-32).
- clarity for error handling.
